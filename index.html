                    About The Website
                </h1>
                This program is a part of our examination work in high school. The main focus of this website is to visualize and help students to picture what time dilation looks like. This can also be used by teachers all over the world in order to make it easier for
                their students to learn about interstellar travels and time dilation. <br><br> As of today, scientists and astronauts that work in the scientific and space field are trying to explore space to expand our understanding of
                the universe and discover perhaps new life or a new civilization. However, us humans have a limited life span and limited resources for interstellar travel. In order to travel fast in a reasonable time frame we have to travel at the speed
                of light which currently is impossible. There are obstacles we have yet to overcome, obstacles like relativity and time dilatation. With this project we believe we can get a better understanding of these obstacles that keep us from achieving
                us to the stars and beyond. <br><br> The created website whose purpose is to explain time dilation and the theory of relativity is meant to give better acknowledgement to the overall public. The website’s goal is to aid and provide both
                students and others the information they need to both calculate and understand the theories. One of the questions that this paper will answer is What time dilation is and How the program of the website is created.

                    About TimeDilation
                </h1>
                Perhaps you have heard of Time dilation and thought of time traveling, or the twin paradox where one twin travels to space and comes back younger. It gives you an idea of what time dilation is but does not really explain the theory itself. For this section,
                the theory of Time dilation will be explained and described in a less complicated way with an approach to give the reader an introduction to the subject. <br><br>
                <!--break-->
                Time dilation is described as how time passes differently for different observers based on their relative movement. Time is not absolute and the velocity, while time passes, is different for observers in different reference frames. Let us take an example
                of an event with time dilation: Imagine a mirror on the ground and a mirror on the roof of a train or fast-moving vehicle. Now imagine a light pulse traveling in between these two mirrors in the train. An observer inside the train will
                observe that the light pulse traveling up and down between the mirrors will move in a vertical motion. While a stationary observer watching the train will see the train shifted to the right and perceive that the light pulse gives an angled
                path. <br><br>
                <!--break-->

                This is known as ”Einstein’s Simple Clock” which was a thought experiment the scientist Albert Einstein came up with. He thought of what could have been the ”easiest clock” and in this case, each reflection of the light pulse is a tic on the clock. This
                is an example of a phenomenon with time dilation. Another example of time dilation is when two identical twins are exposed to different velocities. There is one stationary twin and another twin traveling near the speed of light. When the
                traveling twin comes back it appears to be a bit younger. <br><br>
                <!--break-->

                One thing to know is that we are all under the effect of time dilation but at a low level. The effect is much clearer when near the speed of light. When you are near that velocity is when you will experience that time runs much slower than if you were
                stationary. Experimenting with the theory of time dilation has been done many times before in different ways such as the ”Simple Clock” and also the ”Hafele Keating Experiment”. The space organization NASA has also tested the theory of
                time dilation. In 2019 NASA published a twins study result. There were two twins, Scott and Mark Kelly, Scott spent one year in space and Mark stayed on Earth. When Scott came back, it resulted through time dilation that the stationary
                twin on earth was 5 mili seconds younger. Because Scott did not travel any near the speed of light it resulted in his aging was not as apparent as you would see in the Sci-fi movie Interstellar. We have not achieved a velocity near the
                speed of light yet. If you were thinking of becoming younger than your classmates, going to space will not really solve that. <br><br>
                <!--break-->

                There are also formulas to count the time dilation between observers. This however can be seen in the Calculator section. Time dilation is in the theory of relativity which is a theory discovered by the scientist Albert Einstein. A quick explanation of
                the general and special theory of relativity will be found in that section of the website.

                    About the Theory of Relativily
                </h1>
                The German scientist Albert Einstein invented the theory of relativity which consists of two parts, the special theory of relativity from 1905 and the general one from 1915. Einstein showed how time and space were interwoven that had not previously been
                realized. <br><br>

                <h3>
                    General Relativity:
                </h3>

                You can perceive the theory of relativity as a theory about gravity. Instead of seeing gravity as an invisible force that attracts objects to each other, you can perceive it as a distortion or curvature of space. The larger the object is, the more space
                will distort around it. Imagine yourself a heavy ball that lands on a piece of paper and then the sheet becomes distorted. Instead of mass being drawn to mass, the ball follows the curvature of the room.Gravity can also distort time. Let’s
                take another example. Imagine a person climbing to the top of a mountain with his clock, now his clock would start to tick a lot faster than a person who would be at the bottom of the mountain. This is due to the difference in gravity
                in each location. <br><br>
                <!--break-->

                In the general theory of relativity, it is shown that gravity curves space and time. There have been multiple experiments done to prove the general theory of relativity. One example was a star named Stein 2051 B that seemed to change position in the sky
                but in reality, the position had not changed. The effect of ”gravitational lensing” occurred due to the curvature of space.
                <!--break--><br><br>

                <h3>
                    Special Relativity:
                </h3>

                In the theory of special relativity, Einstein explained how time and space were connected to each other. There are two basic concepts to know about <br> <br>
                <li>
                    As long as an object continues in a straight motion at a constant speed (without acceleration), the laws of physics apply the same to everyone.
                </li> <br>
                <li> *The speed of light travels at an unchanging speed of 186 000 km per second.</li> <br> <br> Important notice is that no matter how fast an observer moves or how fast an object emits light rays, measuring the speed of flight will always
                give the same results. Let us give you an example of an effect that can occur with special relativity – Picture yourself in a high-speed aircraft and you suddenly pass your friend who is in an identical craft but at a much slower speed.
                You will start to see that time goes much faster for you (Read Timedilation). If your aircraft increases its speed, both your mass and the mass of the craft will increase. The faster you go, the heavier you and your aircraft will be and
                the more will your aircraft withstand your efforts to go faster. Another thing that will also occur when you travel that fast is that your friend's aircraft will seem smaller than yours although they are identical. With these points, Einstein
                came to the conclusion that nothing with mass can achieve the speed of light. <br><br>
                <!--break-->

                You might have also heard about the infamous equation: E = mckvadrat (E stands for energy, m for mass, c for the speed of light). The equation is a consequence of special relativity and also shows that energy and matter are interchangeable with the help
                of the equation.
